## About Me

I am currently a sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Civil Engineering. Through my classes I have found interest in building, designing, and creating as well as working with others, which has led me to purse an engineering degree. I hope to positively impact the communities I work in, as well as others around me through my career.
