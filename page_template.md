## About Me

I am currently a sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Civil Engineering. Through my classes I have found interest in building, designing, and creating as well as working with others, which has led me to purse an engineering degree. I hope to positively impact the communities I work in, as well as others around me through my career.

## Projects

### Project 1: Water Systems Evaluation 
We provided a statistical summary of violations in Nebraska by public water type, evaluation of Contaminants by PWS type and population category, and created a table based on PWS Type, Contaminant, Population Category, Violation Type. Overall, python tool found serious violations of contaminants in water systems.

### Project 2:  
We created a python tool that helped the firm solve standard static calculations. The program included the ability to perform unit conversion and analysis, the ability to handle distributed and point loads acting on static members, and the flexibility to provide consistent calculations in response to variable user inputs including load, magnitude, location, and angle of application. Overall, python tool was able to solve statics problems for the client in a timely manner.

### Project 3:  
The group imported clean data and data analysis, created visualizations of trends in the data, and monitored and recorded the time it takes to create the tool. Overall, python tool created various graphs to show trends in data for the  client.

### Project 4:  
The group identified bias and created visual comparisons of risk factors in two states. The two states that our group had selected were Montana and Colorado. While creating the code, we found there were various NA/missing values that could make the risk value produced by NRI biased. To limit bias, we removed these values and replaced them with values that python code read. This allowed for more accurate graphs for comparison. Overall, python tool found that both states has bias within the datasets and that once removed, graphs became more accurate.

### Project 5:  
The group created a python tool that automated concrete mix designs based on user specifications. To create the tool, we took the different required values needed for a concrete mix design and asked the user for different inputs. The inputs were then changed into float or integer values once in the python tool. Then, our group created a function that defined all the numbers for the mix design. The inputs were plugged into formulas that helped automate the concrete mix design.
